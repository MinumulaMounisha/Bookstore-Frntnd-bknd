# Bookstore-Frntnd-bknd

It contains two folders frontend and backend.
Frontend is designed using Angular version 12 and Backend is designed using Node.js express framework and mangodB for database.

This is my first trail on backend just tried to understand how backend works by performing some basic crud operations.

I have used some packages available like bodyParser, dotenv, joi, JWT which is jsonwebtoken for login security,bcrypt for hashing password, mongoose, routers and cors helps in enabling Access-Control-Allow-Origin CORS header to avoid conflicts in localhost servers.
